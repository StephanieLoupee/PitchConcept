# PitchConcept

If you buy a quilt pattern, it lists the materials needed to finish the project.  But there are also free web sites
that have directions for different block patterns.  Enterprising quilters might use these block patterns (or new patterns
of their own devising) to design a quilt.  The block pattern sites often do not provide a materials list, since they are only
describing how to build the block, not proposing how it is to be used in a project. 

I would like to see a web site where a person could plan a quilt project using either blocks of their own making or blocks
pulled from a different source.  The ideal site would:
  - allow the user to "build a block" (or unit made up of multiple blocks) and define how large the block would be in the project
  - allow the user to define the size of the finished project
  - allow the user to "color" the block or blocks to represent the number of fabrics to be used in the project
  - determine the size and shape of pieces required (including seam allowances) from the "build a block"
  - determine how many blocks (or units) are required for the project based on the desired size (in whole blocks)
    - if the desired size cannot be achieved with the size blocks specified, the app should show the blocks required
      to make the closest size without exceeding the specified dimensions
  - based on 'standard' or specified usable fabric width, determine the amount of each fabric required to complete
    the user proposed project (to the nearest 1/8th yard - 4.5 inches)
    
A 'toned down' version might require the user to provide the measurements and number of cut pieces to make one 
block (or unit) and group them according to fabrics to be used. 

An 'upscaled' version might allow the user to specify 'sashing' (strips separating the blocks) and/or 'borders' (strips 
around the outside of the main patterned area) to be included in the size and fabric calculations.  It might also draw out
a representation of the completed project to demonstrate what the completed project might look like.  It might also
allow the user to specify (choose) from multiple construction techniques for certain sub-units of the blocks (which would
affect the cutting sizes and shapes of some pieces).
    

USER STORIES

1) As a user, I want the app to calculate how much fabric I need to make a specific number of pieces of a specific size and
   shape, because this is a tedious process that I don't want to have to do manually.
2) As a designer, I would like the app to be able to determine what size of pieces need to be cut, based on a drawing of a
   "finished" block, so that I don't make errors in accounting for seam allowances, ensuring that my stitched block
   will be the size I intend.
3) As a user, I would like the app to tell me how many blocks I need to make a project of the size I specify, so that I
   don't miscalculate on my own. 
    a) If it is not possible to get to the size I specify using whole blocks, as a user, I would like the app to tell 
       me the nearest size that can be made with whole blocks, without going larger than my specified size.
4) As a product owner, I want secure access to the app.
5) 


31) As a user, I want to be able to define the size/shape of my block, so that I can base a project on a square, rectangle, hexagon, or any other shape I choose.
32) As a user, I want to 'color' my block, so that I can differentiate the different fabrics I use in my project
